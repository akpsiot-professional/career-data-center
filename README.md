## To Run Locally 

1. Clone the Repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## To Publish and Deploy

1. `npm run deploy`
2. Navigate to the Github repo settings (you must be signed into the professional account)
3. Set the custom domain (ex: otportal.org)

## Custom Domain
I have the domain for the next year. If it expires you can renew it with your own account. If you want to redirect it before it expires - message me at sethkujawa@gmail.com. If you want to use a new custom domain then change both the `package.json` and the `CNAME` files.

## API
The backend API is almost identical to the back-end-example. It's running on a free express server through Microsoft Azure. TBH the free service has a lot of issues with latency so I would recommend an upgrade if ppl actually use this.
